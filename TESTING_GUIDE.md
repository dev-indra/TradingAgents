## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: **Dropdown Functionality**
1. ✅ Click the dropdown in the header center
2. ✅ See all 4 providers with icons and status
3. ✅ Notice "LM Studio" shows FREE badge
4. ✅ Each provider shows connection status (probably red ❌ since not configured)

### Test 2: **LM Studio Connection** (If you have it running)
1. ✅ Ensure LM Studio is running with a loaded model
2. ✅ Dropdown should show LM Studio as "Connected ✅"
3. ✅ Status indicator should be green
4. ✅ FREE badge should be visible

### Test 3: **Provider Configuration**
1. ✅ Click dropdown → Select any provider → "Configure Settings"
2. ✅ Modal opens with provider-specific setup instructions
3. ✅ For LM Studio: Shows setup guide with links
4. ✅ For others: Shows API key input fields
5. ✅ Close modal by clicking "Cancel" or X

### Test 4: **Status Notifications**
1. ✅ Switch between providers in dropdown
2. ✅ Should see toast notifications appear (top-right)
3. ✅ Notifications show connection status

4. ✅ FREE badge shows for LM Studio

## 🎯 Expected Status (Without API Keys)

| Provider | Expected Status | Reason |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| LM Studio | ✅ Connected (if running) / ❌ Disconnected | Depends on if you have LM Studio running |
| OpenRouter | ❌ Disconnected | No API key configured |
| Anthropic | ❌ Disconnected | No API key configured |  
| OpenAI | ❌ Disconnected | No API key configured |

## 🔧 Quick Fixes if Something's Not Working

### Dropdown Not Showing?
```bash
# Refresh the Docker container
docker-compose restart web-ui
```

### Connection Issues?
- The API will try to connect to LM Studio at `localhost:1234`
- For Docker, this means the container's localhost, not your machine
- This is expected - the status will show properly once configured

### Want to Test LM Studio Integration?
1. Start LM Studio on your machine
2. Load a model and start the server
3. The status should update to show connected

## 🎊 Success Indicators

✅ **Dropdown appears** in header center  
✅ **4 providers listed** with icons  
✅ **Status indicators** show for each provider  
✅ **FREE badge** appears for LM Studio  
✅ **Configuration modal** opens when clicking settings  
✅ **Toast notifications** appear when switching providers  
✅ **Provider info** shows in analysis sections  

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you see everything working:
1. **Configure a cloud provider** (OpenRouter recommended)
2. **Test switching** between local and cloud models
3. **Run analyses** with different providers
4. **Compare costs** (FREE vs. paid indicators)
